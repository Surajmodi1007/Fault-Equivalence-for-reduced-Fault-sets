# Fault-Equivalence-for-reduced-Fault-sets

â€¢Created a Python script that processes an ISCAS netlist input for the C-17 Benchmark circuit, determining equivalence for stuck-at faults to streamline testing. This approach is crucial for minimizing the number of faults to be checked, aligning with Time-to-Market (TMT) constraints.
